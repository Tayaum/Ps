## if
Syntax of if:

```
if Condition then
    #Code
end
```
```Condition``` can be:

Less than or equal to: ```a <= b```

Greater than: ```a > b```

Greater than or equal to: ```a >= b```

or any Function or Variable that Return ```True``` or ```1```
like the ```True``` Variable Because ```True``` Variable always Have the Value of 1

Example:
```

    print( "2 Equals 2")
end

if not 2 == 2 then
    print( "2 is not Equals 2")

2 Equals 2
```

```print("2 is not Equals 2")``` Never runs Because 2 can't not be 2
